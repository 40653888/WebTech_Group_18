        <h3> Lets have a look at some history ?</h3>
        <p> Jazz, a genre originating from African-American communities
             in America between the late 19th - early 20th centuaries
              consists of a lot of unique and special features such as
               improvisation, polyrythms, and syncopation. Having a listen
                to Jazz music, it can be derived the influence from what
                 come before it, blues music. Jazz exists as a creative
                  artwork which allows the musician to creatively express
                   themselves without faltering to any one specific rythim 
                   or sound. One of the earliest styles of jazz known today 
                   would be New Orlean's Jazz, this type of jazz meshed together
                    several aspects, these are; brass march bands, French Quadrilles,
                     ragtime, and blues. But what brings together this Jazz is the
                      implimentation of improvisation, well known in RagTime.
